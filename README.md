# EnKF_Inversion
Coupled and uncoupled approaches for hydrogeophysical inversions

The repository contains the following files/folders:

- codes: coupled and uncoupled inversion codes as in Camporese et al. (WRR 2015). Main sources are in Matlab language, with 
         calls to an external program (mcfean, for flow and transport) in Fortran.
- isotropy: ERT inversions for the isotropic scenarios;
- anisotropy: ERT inversions for the anisotropic scenarios.
