Coupled and uncoupled approaches for hydrogeophysical inversions (Camporese et al., WRR, 2015)

The repository contains the following files/folders:

- codes: coupled and uncoupled inversion codes as in Camporese et al. (2015). Main sources are in Matlab language, with 
         calls to an external program (mcfean, for flow and transport) in Fortran.
- isotropy: ERT inversions for the isotropic scenarios;
- anisotropy: ERT inversions for the anisotropic scenarios;
- scenario4: results of coupled and uncoupled analyses on isotropic scenario 4.
